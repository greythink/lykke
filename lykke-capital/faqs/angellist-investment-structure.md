title: AngelList India's investment structure
---



AngelList India is a SEBI registered Angel Fund, a sub-category of VCF under Category- I AIF. A separate scheme/ SPV is created for investment into each startup company.
When investing through AngelList India (an AIF), investors do not receive 'shares' but instead get 'units' of that particular scheme allotted (as mentioned in the drawdown notice), since investors aren't directly investing in the company, but through AngelList India.

'Unit Statements' are issued with the investors biannually for the account value as of September and March of a particular financial year.
