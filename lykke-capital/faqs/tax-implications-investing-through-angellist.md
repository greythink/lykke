title: What are the tax implications of investing through AngelList Indiaâ€™s SEBI regulated "Angel Fund"?
---



At the time of making an investment, the angel investor becomes part of AngelList India, which is registered with SEBI as an Angel Fund under the AIF Regulations. Under the (Indian) Income-tax Act, 1961, Angel Funds have been accorded pass through status in respect of all incomes (except business income), i.e. investors are subject to tax in the same nature and same proportion as if they had directly invested in the portfolio companies. There is a 10% withholding at the time of making payments to resident investors and at rates in force in case of non-resident investors, which the investors can claim credit for while filing their tax returns.
