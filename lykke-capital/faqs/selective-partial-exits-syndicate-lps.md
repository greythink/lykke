title: Selective or partial exits to Syndicate LPs?
---



- Exits are decided by the Syndicate leads
- Exit opportunity and terms need to be applied Syndicate-wide, to all the LPs. There is no provision of giving individual exits to select LPs.
- Partial exits are possible and will be applied Syndicate-wide. *ie- Liquidating 50% of a Syndicate's holding in a company and keeping the remaining 50% intact.*
