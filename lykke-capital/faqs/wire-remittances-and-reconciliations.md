title: Wire remittances and reconciliations
---


- Investors are required to wire funds from the bank account on the name of investing entity and no one else
- Remittances are NEFT/RTGS transactions to our standard HDFC current account. Cheques are accepted and must be deposited to the neared HDFC bank.
- It takes at least 48-hours for AL India to reconcile wires. Reconciled wires are reflected in your Lead Dashboard and investors get an email confirmation regarding the same.
- Received funds from investors get updated on the Lead Dashboard every Monday-Wednesday-Friday evenings.
