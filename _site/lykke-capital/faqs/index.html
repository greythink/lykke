When investing through AngelList India (an AIF), investors do not receive 'shares' but instead get 'units' of that particular scheme allotted (as mentioned in the drawdown notice), since investors aren't directly investing in the company, but through AngelList India.</p>
<p>'Unit Statements' are issued with the investors biannually for the account value as of September and March of a particular financial year.</p>

There is a 10% withholding at the time of making payments to resident investors and at rates in force in case of non-resident investors, which the investors can claim credit for while filing their tax returns.</p>
